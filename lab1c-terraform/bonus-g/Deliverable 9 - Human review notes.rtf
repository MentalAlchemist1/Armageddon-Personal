\cf0  I reviewed the Bedrock-generated report against the JSON evidence bundle. Executive Summary correctly identified the alarm trigger. Root Cause Analysis appropriately marked as Unknown since this was a simulated event with no actual DB errors. WAF data (2 ALLOW, 1 BLOCK from 176.65.134.20) accurately reflected in the report. Password was not present in either the evidence or the report. No hallucinated claims detected \'97 all Unknown fields correctly flagged. Conclusion: AI summarizes, humans interpret.\
